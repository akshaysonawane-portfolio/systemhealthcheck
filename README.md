`systemhealthcheck` is a lightweight, production-style Python package that exposes real-time system health metrics.  
It includes both:

- A **fast API-safe `get_health()` function**, and  
- A **console-based monitoring CLI tool** that prints metrics at fixed intervals.

This project is ideal for learning, DevOps demonstrations, monitoring scripts, and showcasing your Python packaging skills.
